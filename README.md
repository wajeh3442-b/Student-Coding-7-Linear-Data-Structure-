🧮 Mini Data Structure Management System (Java)
📘 Overview

This Java console-based project demonstrates fundamental data structures using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
It includes:

Array Operations

Linked List Types (Singly, Doubly, Circular)

Stack Implementation

Queue Implementation

Expression Conversion (Infix → Postfix / Prefix)

🧠 Features
🔹 Array Operations

Create an array and input elements

Traverse and display array

Insert or delete an element by position

Search for a specific element

🔹 Linked List Operations

Types Included:

Singly Linked List

Insert at beginning, position, or end

Delete from beginning, position, or end

Search and traverse (shown as 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> NULL)

Doubly Linked List

Insert and display elements (NULL <-> 10 <-> 20 <-> NULL)

Circular Linked List

Insert and display elements (10 -> 20 -> 30 -> (Back to head))

🔹 Stack Operations

Push multiple characters

Pop top element

Peek top value

Display all stack elements

Infix to Postfix conversion

Infix to Prefix conversion

🔹 Queue Operations

Enqueue (add) elements

Dequeue (remove) elements

Peek front element

Display all elements

💻 How to Run

Make sure you have Java JDK 17+ installed.

Save the file as Main.java.

Open terminal or command prompt and compile:

javac Main.java


Then run the program:

java Main
